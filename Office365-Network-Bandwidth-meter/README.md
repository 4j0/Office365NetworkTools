# /Office 365 Network Bandwidth meter/ 
This is a beta solution we released recently in September 2018 to: 
1. Measure network bandwidth usage for pilot users on-boarded to Office 365 or network bandwidth usage of on-premises users. 
2. Build and maintain endpoint monitoring dashboards post on-boarding users to Office 365 

This solution uses Azure monitoring, specifically Service Map. You can apply this concept for measuring any SaaS/PaaS traffic, not just Office 365. 

This solution will allow you to monitor and analyse the following example scenarios: 

• Bandwidth used for a particular process or set of processes over a set period of time 

• Bandwidth used by the machine over a set period of time 

• Bandwidth used in connections to a specific port 

• Bandwidth used to a specific IP address or range of addresses 

• IP geolocation of the endpoints connected to
