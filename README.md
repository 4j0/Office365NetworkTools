# Microsoft Office 365 Network Tools

Welcome to the home for Microsoft Office 365 Network Tools. Through this initiative we are collecting tools, scripts, and guidance from across engineering teams with the aim to make them easier to find, grow, and improve with help from the community and partners.

## Folders & Description:

#### /Office 365 Network Bandwidth meter/ 
This is a beta solution we released recently in September 2018 to: 
1. Measure network bandwidth usage for pilot users on-boarded to Office 365 or network bandwidth usage of on-premises users. 
2. Build and maintain endpoint monitoring dashboards post on-boarding users to Office 365 

This solution uses Azure monitoring, specifically Service Map. You can apply this concept for measuring any SaaS/PaaS traffic, not just Office 365.
